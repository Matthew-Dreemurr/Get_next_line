
## Why does the code look weird ?

The 42 curriculum asks us to code according to the `Norme`, this standard forbids us certain control structures (like `do while`, `for`, ...), a limit of 25 lines and 5 variables per function, 5 function max per `.c` and and other constraints.

This project has been coded according to the `NormeV3` standard.
